        This program focuses on improving the overall health and well-being of
        underserved communities, especially in rural and hard-to-reach areas.
        Activities include organizing regular rural medical outreaches that
        provide free consultations, basic treatments, and essential medications
        to individuals who have limited access to healthcare. It also promotes
        maternal and child health through awareness campaigns on safe pregnancy,
        breastfeeding, nutrition, and immunization. Additionally, the program
        invests in clean water initiatives, such as borehole construction and
        water purification systems, to prevent waterborne diseases and support
        healthier living conditions.
